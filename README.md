# ft_printf
Because ft_putnbr and ft_putstr arenâ€™t enough.  The goal of this projectis pretty straight forward. I will recode printf.  Using unknown numbers of argument for ft_printf paramater. How cool is that?

You need to have libft repository too. When you clone the repository libft folder comes empty. in order to call ft_printf function makefile needs source files from libft and libft folder must be updated with libft repository.
